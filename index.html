<div style="text-align: justify"> Hi! My name is Milena Jessen and I am a second-year PhD student in economics at the Bonn Graduate School of Economics. 
     I am interested in behavioral economics and political economy. If you would like to get in touch to talk about research, please contact me under mjessen(at)uni-bonn.de. <br> <br>
